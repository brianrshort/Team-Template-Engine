# Team-Template-Engine

This program uses command line interface (CLI) to take input in from the use and generate an HTML file 
that highlights important details of various members of a professional team. 

To complete this project, I developed fluency with Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices, separation of concerns, node.js, javascript, JSON, and Command Line Interface (CLI) input and dependencies.

Let's take a quick tour of how to use the app.

First, use Node.js to execute the file and respond to the input prompts:

The prompt gives options to include multiple engineers and multiple interns, if desired, on the final page. Once finished, a new HTML file is generated. The images below show a portion of the final HTML code and a screenshot of the final rendered HTML page.

And test for all four of our classes passed (always a good sign!).
